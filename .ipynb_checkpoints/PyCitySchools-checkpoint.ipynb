    "    -School size has a large impact on math and reading scores.  Only 58% of students at Large schools (more than 5000 students) passed both reading and math, compared to roughly 90% of small and medium size schools\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Interestingly, having a higher budget per student does not increase the likelihood that they will pass reading and math.  Only 54% of students at schools that spend more than 645 dollars passed both math and reading, compared to 90% of students at schools that spend less than 585.  However, given that the buckets for spend are group closely together, I would use caution coming to the conclusion that investing in students does not yield results."
